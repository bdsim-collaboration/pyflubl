# TODO list

* Flexible material (g4 material, fluka material)
* FLUKA and GDML input custom objects
* Lattice for custom FLUKA and GDML objects 
* Magnetic field for dipole and quadrupole objects 
* Scoring mesh 
* Samplers 
* Labelling of external g4 geometry (vacuum and outer container)
* Labelling of external fluka geometry (vacuum for field)
* Options similar to BDSIM for beampipe and external "container" volume
* Ask CERN group for (original) FLUKA magnet geometry
* ~~Define FLUKA beamline element~~
* ~~Flexible geometry source (g4registry, fregistry)~~
* ~~Fix bend rotation~~ 
* ~~Add generic rotation (transform3d)~~
